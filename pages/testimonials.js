                <h2>Christopher Geary</h2>
                <h3>Co-worker @ Indigo Tree Digital</h3>
                <p>
                    He and I worked together at IndigoTree, where his position was &apos;Web Developer&apos; and my
                    position was &apos;Senior Web Developer&apos;. Eugene has great communication skills, a high
                    attention to detail, and a wealth of experience with content management systems. Those combined with
                    his understanding of web development, earnt him full ownership of projects, which was unheard of for
                    a developer at IndigoTree. During the 3 years we worked together, Eugene always demonstrated he was
                    motivated and keen to learn. He was proactive about doing his own research first, but was equally
                    not afraid to ask questions or gain a second opinion. This, coupled by his attention to detail,
                    meant he would make notes and document his findings, which proved to be invaluable for the company,
                    as those notes formed the basis of the companies online internal knoweldge base, which he promptly
                    became responsible for. Eugene is an absolute delight to work with, he&apos;s a very likeable
                    person, always has a positive attitude, and a great team player. I wouldn&apos;t hesitate to work
                    with him again.

                <p>
                    Eugene worked with us for three and a half years and was instrumental to the growth of our agency.
                    Not only was he a dependable Project Manager loved by our team and our clients, but also a proactive
                    contributor to our wider business strategy and management. He has a genuine passion for WordPress
                    and the web, and consistently goes above and beyond to support teammates and clients. In addition to
                    his role as Project Manager, Eugene rose to the challenge of managing the agency on numerous
                    occasions during my absence, and is one of the very few people that I would ever trust to do this.
                    His loyalty and trust are beyond doubt. His departure will be a great loss to our team, but a great
                    asset to any team that he joins in the future.
                </p>
