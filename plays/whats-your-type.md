This is one of my favourites. I thought it would be easier to put together 15 different font families; far from it. I got the idea from the <a href="https://profilebooks.com/work/just-my-type/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">“Just My Type” book</a> book. If you curious, click each letter to learn what font I used.
