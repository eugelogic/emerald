I always liked the way the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodic_table" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">periodic table</a> looked, it's so well organised. One day I
wondered if I could make up my name with some of the elements.

Whenever I can I like to use <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/named-color" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">css named colours</a> since they are easier to remember. The font is
<a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Raleway" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Raleway</a>.
