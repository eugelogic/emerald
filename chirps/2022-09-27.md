When I take a look at a new website, there is something I always check, it’s the <mark>copyright year</mark> at the bottom of the page. If it’s not up to date I cry. I wonder how that is possible in this day and age of web frameworks which do everything automagically for you.

I personally use `new Date().getFullYear()` to make sure it's always up to date.
