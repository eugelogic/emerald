Kudos to [@PARKSIDEUK](https://twitter.com/PARKSIDEUK) for adding a feature to their website [parkside.co.uk](https://www.parkside.co.uk) where if you are not interacting with the UI for a while it will show an energy saving page #digitalsustainability 👍🏼 😎 👏🏼

I'm not entirely sure how it works behind the scenes by I guess it must be a time/movement api in the dom 🤔
