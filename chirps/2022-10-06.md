I don't like when websites ask you for your full <mark>date of birth</mark>. It feels like such a dark patter. I actually recall an articles that said to [give social networks fake details, advises Whitehall web security official](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-20082493) unless it was stricly necessary ie for finalcial services, medical notes, goverment documents, driving licence, car insurance and the likes.
If it's social media, a lerning portal of a tv channel to say a few, they don't really need to know your exact date of birth, do they?

When I read companies saying "knowing your date of birth allows us to customise your experience", I'm very doubtful. I say share a date that is close enough to your real date of birth but not the exact one, ie if you were born on the 15th of October 1990 (like me 😜 jk), just share the 16th of November 1991, which is easier to remember as you add 1 to all the entries. If the web company want to wish you happy birthday on that day and they got the wrong date, who cares, as long as your friends and family know when that is 🎂.

If all these websites need to know is that we are over a certain age, they can show a box to tick. There are some websites like ... that does exactly that 👏🏼
