## Sad Face

As I said I like this website a lot but here are a couple of comments if I really want to be picky.

I have an issue with slants when they are used just for the sake of it, they literally make me dizzy. I've seen many around and I can't think of an instance where I thought they added to the experience.

Moreover, at different stages there is something that is making the fan on my macbook pro go berserk. It's probably the graphic card which can't handle the animations, maybe they could be optimised.
