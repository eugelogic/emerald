I bumped into this website whilst browsing the listings on [awwwards](https://www.awwwards.com/sites/tiger-marketing).

Its illustrations drew my attention immediantly and I knew I was onto something special.

This brochure marketing website powered by [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/) made me feel like I was entering the jungle.

The hero banner is very captivating. I like the illustration and the leaves moving and revealing hidden animanls is simply genius. Furthermore, if you move the mouse around there is also a subtle parallax effect and if you patient enough a tiger will be reviealed as well.

Whoever designed the leaves spent an aweful amount of time and did an amazing job.

I must admit they could have made a better job at composing the mission statement as it's not obvious what it is that they do but it does mention under the site name so I guess it's fine. Moreover, the caption is not particularly readeble in terms of contrast with the background.

With regards of the compulsory cookie notice, it's low profile and unintrusive but they do not provide the option to opt out.

## Illustration & Animation

![tigermarketing.co.uk illustration](/tigermarketing-co-uk-illustration.jpg)

They did a good job at exploiting what the fauna of the tropics have to offer when they selected animals to represent each of their services. The chameleon is my favourite, it reminds me of the national service I did when I was young. There is a little animation as you mouse over as well.

I suppose they could have made the mouse over of other elements react more explicitly, the buttons seems to have a faint change of shadow and the main navigation menu labels have an equally faint change of colour.

Not to mention the links in the paragraphs, they are virtually invisible as they are not distinguishable from the rest of the text; I guess it could be easily fixed with an underline.

## Colour Palette

<div class="colRow">
    <div class="colHalf">
        <ul class="colourPalette">
            <li class="hexCol-e05f0c">#e05f0c</li>
            <li class="hexCol-dfe4d4">#dfe4d4</li>
            <li class="hexCol-a7bf81">#a7bf81</li>
            <li class="hexCol-405d18">#405d18</li>
        </ul>
</div>
    <div class="colHalf">
        <p>
            Very nice and mellow colour palette. I particularly like the different shades of green which go well with the contrasting orange.
        </p>

            Extra bonus points for implementing a dark mode version, I reckon all websites should have that enabled by default, like mine.

## Typography

![tigermarketing.co.uk typography](/tigermarketing-co-uk-typography.jpg)

Good implementation of typography, they used two font families which create a nice contrast.

They chose [Montserrat](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat) for the body; I happen to use the same for my website :-)

Whereas the headings are implemented by a display font like [Playfair](https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/playfair-display) to spice things up.

I'm not sure why the headings of the [services pages](https://www.tigermarketing.co.uk/marketing-strategies/) use the body font though. I tried to switch the font in the browser dev tools and they do look much nicer.

## Content & Internal Page

<div class="colRow">
    <div class="colHalf">
        <img src="/tigermarketing-co-uk-case-study.jpg" alt="tigermarketing.co.uk case study" >
    </div>
        <div class="colHalf">
            <p>
                The internal pages are very tidy, readable, well organised and succinct; they definitely know how to do marketing.
            </p>
            <p>
                The case studies are short and insightful; they features four topic paragraphs that they go straight to the point without any filler and make sure you read them.
            </p>
            <p>
                They also have useful FAQs at the end of most services pages which are proven to convert.
            </p>
    </div>

The blog posts are well written and easy to digest with short paragraphs and lots of bullet points, covering interesting topics. Unfortunately, when they re-branded the website (I guess), they didn't upgrade the media on each post which now feels outdated.

Here's a small detail I particularly like; the logos of the case study portfolio animate into colour upon hover over.

![tigermarketing.co.uk portfolio logos](/tigermarketing-co-uk-portfolio-logos.jpg)

The footer is minimal, nice and tidy with the usual social links and the newsletter form which if it's as good as the website it's definitely signing up for.

Also the 404 page is nice, I always check that out.

<div class="colRow">
    <div class="colHalf">
        <img src="/tigermarketing-co-uk-footer.jpg" alt="tigermarketing.co.uk footer" >
    </div>
    <div class="colHalf">
        <img src="/tigermarketing-co-uk-404.jpg" alt="tigermarketing.co.uk 404 page" >
    </div>
</div>

## Mobile Experience

The mobile experience is equally good but I wish they had a back-to-the-top button or a sticky header; scrolling all the way up feels like a work out.

<div class="colRow">
    <div class="colHalf">
        <img src="/tigermarketing.co.uk-mobile.jpg" alt="tigermarketing.co.uk mobile" >
    </div>
    <div class="colHalf">
        <img src="/tigermarketing.co.uk-mobile-menu.jpg" alt="tigermarketing.co.uk mobile menu" >
    </div>
</div>

## Sad Face

As I said I like this website a lot but here are a few comments if I really want to be picky.

I guess it's just a personal preference but I have an issue with slants when they are used just for the sake of it. They literally make me dizzy. I've seen many around, not just on this website and I can't think of an instance where I thought they actually added to the user experience. Even worse when there are slant at different angles on the same page.

At different stages there is something that is making the fan on my macbook pro go berserk. It's probably the graphic card which can't handle the animations. On closer inspection, the website seems to perform well according to [GTMetrix](https://gtmetrix.com/reports/www.tigermarketing.co.uk/K2yolIWu/) but some work could be done to improve the delivery of the animations with next-gen formats instead of using gifs maybe.

## Conclusion

![tigermarketing.co.uk sponsor a tiger](/tigermarketing-co-uk-sponsor-a-tiger.jpg)

The website is easy to navigate, use and understand. It's also very creative with lots of useful content. I struggled to decide what screenshots to include since there were so many good ones.

Oh, you might be wondering what a tiger has anything to do with a marketing agency from the South East.
Well they claim to provide glorious, powerful and unique marketing services, just like tigers are.

And they do [sponsor tigers in India](https://www.bornfree.org.uk/adopt-a-tiger).
